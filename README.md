Before you start coding you should fully understand your upcoming work, and know that The Most important goal from any **software** is to *help people*, also we should design as good as we could aiming to helping others.<br>
***Simplicity*** is a must, *Complexity* doesn't mean you are a genuss, it's just ruin the work.
